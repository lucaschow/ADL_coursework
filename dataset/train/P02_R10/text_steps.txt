Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C, fan 180 degrees C, gas 6. Line a large roasting tray with baking paper, remove the stalks from the mushrooms and place them on the tray.
Whisk together the coriander, cumin, ginger, chilli powder, nutmeg, paprika, salt and olive oil with the juice of 1/2 lemon. Drizzle this over the mushrooms and toss to coat.
Sit the mushrooms stalk-side down and cover with another sheet of baking paper. Weigh down the mushrooms with another empty baking tray and roast for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, finely dice the tomatoes and finely slice the red onion. Mix with the zingy lemon juice and season well. Set aside.
When the mushrooms are roasted drizzle them with the sugar syrup, garlic paste, and worcestershire sauce. Roast again for 15 minutes.
Halve each kebab wrap and warm in a griddle pan.
On each wrap pile on the tomato salad for crunch followed by the sliced mushrooms. Drizzle the kebabs with the yogurt or aioli, if using, grated parmesan, and chilli sauce to taste.
