Microwave potatoes for 4-6 minutes until just soft
Cut the potatoes into chunks
When ready to serve, heat 6-8 tbsp sunflower or olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan until you can feel a strong heat rising.
If your pan isn't large enough, fry the potatoes in two batches - rather than crowding them. Have kitchen paper ready to drain them on. Add the potatoes in a single layer, not too tightly packed.
Turn the heat to medium-high, so that the potatoes sizzle, but don't stir until they start to brown underneath.
Turn them all evenly 2 or 3 times until nicely browned all over - this can take about 7 mins.
Then lift out with a fish slice or large spoon. Sprinkle with sea salt.
