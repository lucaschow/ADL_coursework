The meat: Sweat one chopped onion in a pot, for a few minutes and then add minced garlic, then place the meat in the pot and on high heat while continuing stirring let the meat cook until the red color turns into more brownish, the idea here is not to fully cook the meat, but perhaps to get all the water out, this will help to get rid of all the water residue that comes out of the meat.
Lower the heat, add some water if needed, a stock cube, cinamon, and additional pepper and leave for a total of 15 minutes.
The rice: start by soaking the rice in some room temperature tap water, with some salt, for at least 2 hours. Once soaking period is over, rinse the rice well until water runs clear to get rid of any excess starchiness.
Finish: Add the pre-prepared minced meat to the rice. Mix thoroughly.
