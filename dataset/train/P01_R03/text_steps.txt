cook your choice of pasta in a large pot of generously salted boiling water until al dente.
Toast the grounded peppercorns until fragrant in a frying pan (with little butter) over medium heat, about 2 minutes. Keep them moving to prevent them from burning.
While the pasta cooks, add freshly grated parmigano cheese to the crushed black peppercorns on very low heat. Gradually add a cup of the boiling cooking water to the bowl, constantly mixing and adjusting as necessary to melt the cheese and obtain a silky, smooth sauce that’s able to completely coat the pasta. Finish with a knob of butter to emulsify the sauce
Once your cacio e pepe has become a creamy, silky sauce, add your piping hot pasta to the bowl and toss vigorously to coat.
