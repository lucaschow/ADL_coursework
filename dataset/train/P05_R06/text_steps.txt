Wash the starch out of the jasmine rice. Add to a pan with cold water and salt and bring to the boil. Once boiling, cook for 20 minutes on low with the lid on.
Heat a wok over high heat for 1 to 2 minutes or until it begins to slightly smoke and then add in the oil.
Next, add in the vegetables and nuts and fry for 2 minutes. Cook in batches so as not to overload the pan and boil them.
Pour in soy sauce, siracha sauce, peanut butter, coconut and a bit of boiling water
Serve the vegetable stir-fry over the cooked jasmine rice.
