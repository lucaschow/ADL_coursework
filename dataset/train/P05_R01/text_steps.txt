Heat the oil in a heavy bottomed pan; make sure you have a lid for it.
Add the onions and when they start to sizzle add the whole spices and chillies. Cook on a low heat until the onions are starting to brown.
Add the garlic and finger chillies to the pan and cook for a minute more.
Add the curry Masala or ground spices to the pan and continue to cook on a low heat for 45 seconds
Add the diluted tomato puree, stir in and cook for 30 seconds or so.
Add the tomatoes, mango chutney and salt, stir in and bring to a simmer. Turn the heat to the lowest you can (a heat diffuser on gas works a treat) and put the lid on. Leave to cook for around 20 minutes.
Take the lid off and stir. If it looks a little dry add a splash of water. Add the Garam Masala. Stir in and put the lid back on. Leave to cook for another 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes remove the lid and stir. If you like a thick sauce you may want to turn the heat up now and let it reduce down. If the sauce looks a little oily for your taste you can use a ladle to skim some of the oil off.
Add the chickpeas and spinach, and later add the coconut milk and the juice of half a lemon. Season to taste.
Add some coconut milk and a squeeze of lemon, to taste
Stir in the fresh coriander and serve over plain boiled rice with a chapatti or roti.
