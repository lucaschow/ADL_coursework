Boil water using kettle
Grind coffee beans using the electric coffee grinder

Pour water into the V60. Pour enough hot water to soak all the coffee grounds, then wait until most water is filtered through.
Slowly pour over the remaining water over the coffee, making small circles. Stop when the water is 3/4 of the way or 2 cm from the top.
