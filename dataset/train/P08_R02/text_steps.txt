To make this salad, start by preparing the dressing. Whisk the dressing ingredients together, in a small bowl, until they're fully combined. Taste and add additional seasonings, if desired.
Next, chop your cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, carrot, coriander, and red onion, and add them to a large bowl alongside the beans and diced tomatoes.
Toss to combine, then pour the dressing on top and toss once more until the salad ingredients are fully coated in the dressing.
Slice piece of sourdough bread and place on side of bowl.
Serve immediately and enjoy!
