Put a large pan of salted water on to boil, and add the pasta
Optionally add garlic, then pound in a pestle and mortar with a pinch of sea salt.
Pick, roughly chop and add the basil leaves, then bash to a paste (or pulse in a food processor).
Add the pine nuts (very lightly toast first, if you like) to the mixture and pound again, then stir in half the Parmesan.
Drizzle in some oil - you need just enough to bind the sauce and get it to an oozy consistency.
Add most of the remaining cheese, then season to perfection with salt and black pepper. Have a taste, and keep adding a bit more cheese or oil until you are happy with the taste and consistency.
Add frozen peas to the pasta with 4 minutes left.
Combine the salad ingredients in a bowl with the oil and vinegar.
Drain the pasta when al dente, and add the pesto.
