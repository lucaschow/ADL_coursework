Heat oil in a pan and throw in some cinnamon sticks, cardamon, cloves, black peppercorn.
Add half of the sliced onion and fry until the onion begin to brown. Set aside the other half for later use.
Add water to the mix along with turmeric and red chili powder and stir.
Then add in the garlic and ginger paste, ghee, yoghurt and stir.
Now add the meat to the mix and stir to mix evenly.
Cover and cook until the meat is cooked through and a bit tender (50 - 55mins), occasionally adding water and stirring to prevent burning and sticking to the pan
Fry the second half of the onions until browned. Once cooked, add to the rest of the mixture.
Once the meat is cooked and tender, add the fried onion, cumin, garam masala, ghee and chili and cook through until the meat is tender.
