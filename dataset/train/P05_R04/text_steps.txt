Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions.
Slice the bacon and place in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with half a tablespoon of olive oil and a really good pinch of black pepper. Leave it to get super-golden and crispy, tossing occasionally, then add the peas
Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl, then finely grate in the Parmesan and mix well.
Mix salad ingredients with oil and vinegar.
Use tongs to transfer your pasta straight into the pan and toss with the bacon.
Pour the Parmesan eggs into the pan, and keep everything moving, loosening with splashes of the pasta cooking water until you have a silky sauce. Make sure the pan isn't too hot otherwise the eggs will scramble.
Plate up the pasta, and finish with an extra grating of Parmesan.
