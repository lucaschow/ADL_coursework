Put dried mushrooms into a large bowl.
Finely chop the onions.
Pour boiling water over the dried mushrooms, stir and soak.
Measure out the pre-chopped garlic.
Wash and chop the fresh chestnut and shiitake mushrooms.
Drain the dried mushrooms into a pan, keeping the liquid.
Crumble vegetable stock cube into the mushroom liquid, then squeeze the mushrooms gently with a fork to remove any liquid.
Heat 3 tbsp olive oil in a shallow saucepan or deep frying pan over a medium flame. Add the pre-chopped garlic and the finely chopped onion into the pan, then fry for about 5 mins until soft, stirring regularly.
Measure out the risotto rice.
Stir in chopped chestnut mushrooms, chopped shiitake mushrooms, and the dried mushrooms
Season with salt and pepper and continue to cook, stirring regularly, for 8 mins until the fresh mushrooms have softened.
Tip risotto rice into the pan and cook for 1 min. Pour over a glass of white wine and let it bubble to nothing so the alcohol evaporates.
Keep the pan over a medium heat and pour in a quarter of the mushroom stock. Simmer the rice, stirring often, until the rice has absorbed all the liquid.
Add about the same amount of stock again and continue to simmer and stir - it should start to become creamy, plump and tender. By the time the final quarter of stock is added, the rice should be almost cooked.
Grate the cheese.
Continue stirring and add the rest of the stock.
When the rice is cooked take the pan off the heat, add butter and scatter over grated parmesan or Grana Padano cheese and tear and scatter a handful of parsley leaves. Chop the rest of the parsley and save for later.
Give the risotto a final stir, add more parsley and taste.
