In a large bowl mix together flour, salt and then add oil. In a separate cup mix yeast with sugar in warm water. Pour over everything else and start kneading until the mix gets doughy and easy to work with. Using your hands rub the bowl with some oil and also rub some on the dough itself while keeping it as a big round shape then cover the bowl with plastic wrapping and a blanket and let it rest for about an hour.
STUFFING. Start preparing the meat stuffing. Sweat one chopped onion in a pot, for a few minutes and then add minced garlic, then place the meat in the pot and on high heat while continuing stirring let the meat cook until the red color turns into more brownish, the idea here is not to fully cook the meat, but perhaps to get all the water out, this will help to get rid of all the water residue that comes out of the meat so it can help the meat stick to the dough while baking.
Lower the heat, add some water if needed and a stock cube and leave for a total of 15 minutes.
Leave the stuffing to cool, then add a spoonful of yoghurt and another spoonful of tahini and a generous amount of sumac.
Bake for about 8-10 minutes or until the bottom turns golden brown.
