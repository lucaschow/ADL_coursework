Cut the cucumber lengthwise down the middle then into 2.4cm/1 inch pieces
Salt 30 minutes - Put them in a bowl then toss with salt. Leave for 30 minutes. The salt will draw out water from the cucumbers which dilutes flavour when you eat them. It also seasons the cucumbers all the way though.
Drain and discard the cucumber water from the bowl (too salty to re-use for another purpose). Use a colander if you want to be thorough else just drain it out of the bowl, using your hand to hold the cucumbers in.
Whisk the soy sauce and sesame oil in a bowl until it combines properly. You'll know because it becomes murky and thicker, rather than clear and split.
Add 2 teaspoons of chilli crisp - or more if you dare! You want to get a mound of the crispy chilli - it will be well soaked with the red chilli oil that colours this salad. You can always add more after you toss. Taste and add, taste and add!
Finally grate and add ginger and garlic to bowl. Toss well then pile up high into a shallow bowl and serve!
