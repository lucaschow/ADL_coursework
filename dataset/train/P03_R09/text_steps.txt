Wash the mushrooms and slice them thinly
Stir fry the mushrooms in a pan with sunflower oil. Add black pepper and garlic powder while cooking.
Stretch the pizza dough using the semolina flour to avoid the dough getting stuck on the hands and surfaces. To stretch the dough first press it with the fingertips, starting from the centre towards the edges, rotating and repeating until it no longer stretches. Then transfer the dough to the back of both hands and slowly rotate and stretch the dough until it reaches the desired size.
Add some semolina flour to the pizza peel, then add the dough on top of it and add all toppings to the pizza: tomato sauce first, then mozzarella, finally mushrooms and the pre-cooked plant-based mince.
Transfer the pizza to the pre-heated pizza oven and cook for 5 minutes. Rotate the pizza halfway through to ensure the pizza is cooked evenly.
