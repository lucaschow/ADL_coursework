In separate pots, boil the chicken and potatoes until cooked through.
Once boiled, drain out any excess water from the potatoes and then mash them.
Once boiled, shred the chicken.
Mix the shredded chicken, mashed potatoes and cheese together.
Scoop some of the mixture and roll in your palms to make a smooth ball. (adjust the quantity of the scooped mixture to obtain your preferred size; repeat this process until all the mixture has been used)
Dredge each Chicken-cheese ball into flour, then dip into egg and roll in the breadcrumbs, ensuring the entire surface of the chicken ball is covered in breadcrumbs.
Heat oil over medium heat, about 2-inch deep to cover the balls halfway at least.
Gently add the chicken cheese balls into the oil, ensuring the pan does not get overcrowded. Fry the balls until golden turning as required to cook through and brown evenly.
