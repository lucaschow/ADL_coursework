heat oven to 220c/fan 200c/gas 7.
Unroll a puff pastry, scatter over a couple of handfuls of grated Parmesan and then grate over the cheddar cheese, then fold in half.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out to the thickness of a 1 pound coin. Cut into 1cm strips, then twist the strips 3-4 times.
Leave to cool, then keep in an airtight container for up to 2 days.
