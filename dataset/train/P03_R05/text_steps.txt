Mix the flour with yeast, salt and water in a large bowl using a wooden spoon
Once the ingredients are roughly mixed, transfer the mixture onto the kitchen top and knead the dough by hand. This is done by rolling the dough on itself several times. Once the dough starts tearing, flatten the dough and fold the 4 edges to form a ball. Let the ball rest for a few minutes between repetitions.
Repeat the previous step several times until the dough is uniform and no longer sticks to the hands.
Split the dough in 2, then flatten and fold each chunk to form a ball.
Coat a plastic container with a little olive oil and place the dough balls in the container.
Let the pizza dough mature and rise for 24 hours in the fridge.
