To a large mixing bowl, add chicken breast, 1 tbsp of olive oil, oregano, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and lemon juice, then mix until combined.
In a non-stick pan, on medium to high heat, add seasoned chicken breast. Cook for 5-10 mins, stirring regularly, until chicken breast is cooked through, showing a golden-brown colour all over and slightly charred.
In a separate small bowl, combine fat free yoghurt, sriracha hot sauce, parsley, salt, pepper and lemon juice until smooth.
Build the wraps: On a tortilla wrap, add shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, chopped onion, spicy chicken and creamy hot sauce, then wrap into a burrito shaped roll or whatever shape desired.
