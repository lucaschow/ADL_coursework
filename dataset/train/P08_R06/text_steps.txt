Cook the pasta according to the package directions. Drain and rinse in warm water, then transfer to a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper and let cool.
Add the tuna, coriander, beans, spinach, bell peppers, carrots, celery, onion, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, and spinach. At this point, you can cover the bowl and refrigerate it until you're ready to serve, up to 6 hours.
Pour the dressing over the top of the salad and toss everything together to coat. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Give the salad a taste - if you think it could use a splash more oil or vinegar, then go for it! Serve the pasta salad immediately, or let it sit at room temperature for up to 2 hours.
