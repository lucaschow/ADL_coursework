Take a large mixing bowl, add 150g of instant dosa mixture to 240ml of water and
Gently stir until completely blended and set aside for a few minutes.
Take a flat non-stick pan, grease it with oil and place on high heat.
Pour sufficient dosa batter on the hot pan and then spread the batter evenly in an outward spiral motion using a dosa ladle. Coat the sides of the dosa with oil and ghee while cooking.
Roast the dosa until it turns golden brown in colour and then remove it from the pan and fold it in half.
