Slice 1 medium onion and slit few green chilies. Grate ginger and few cloves of garlic.
Add the chilli, garlic and ginger into a kitchen mortar and crush them together into a paste using a pestle.
Pour 5 tbsp of olive oil, and 1 tbsp of ghee into to a pressure cooker placed on medium heat. When the oil/ghee mixture becomes hot, add the spices (bay leaf, cardamom, cloves, anise flower etc) and cashew nuts to it and saute for a few minutes allowing them to fry. Once the cashews turn slightly golden brown, add chopped onions and fry it for a while. Then add the spice paste from the mortar into the cooker and saute the mixture.
After a few minutes, add garam masala powder to the cooker and continue to saute until mixed well. Salt maybe added. Then add green peas into the cooker and stir fry for a few minutes under medium heat.
Add 300ml of water and 1tbsp of lemon juice followed by the drained basmati rice and fry on a slightly high flame for 2 to 3 minutes. Mix gently to evenly coat the rice with the cooked masala.
Cover the pressure cooker and place the whistle. Pressure cook for 2 whistles on a medium high flame. Turn off and remove from the stove. Leaving it on the hot burner will further cook the rice
When the pressure drops naturally, open the lid and fluff the peas pulao. The peas pulao is then ready to serve.
