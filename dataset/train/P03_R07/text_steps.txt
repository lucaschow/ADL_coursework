Wash the aubergine and chop it in 2cm cubes
Fry the aubergine with sunflower oil until it's very soft. Add salt and black pepper while cooking.
When the aubergine is ready, move it to a plate with kitchen towel to absorb the oil
Hard-boil the egg in a saucepan for 5 minutes
Peel the egg and slice it in 4 slices
Stretch the pizza dough using the semolina flour to avoid the dough getting stuck on the hands and surfaces. To stretch the dough, first press it with the fingertips, starting from the centre towards the edges, rotating and repeating until it no longer stretches. Then transfer the dough to the back of both hands and slowly rotate and stretch the dough until it reaches the desired size.
Add some semolina flour to the pizza peel, then add the dough on top of it and add all toppings to the pizza: tomato sauce first, then mozzarella, finally aubergine and egg.
Transfer the pizza to the pre-heated pizza oven and cook for 5 minutes. Rotate the pizza halfway through to ensure the pizza is cooked evenly.
