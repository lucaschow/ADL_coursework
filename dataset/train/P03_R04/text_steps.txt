Peel the potatoes and chop them into small chunks.
Fry the potatoes on a medium-heat pan with abundant oil turning the potatoes frequently so that they don't burn. Split larger chunks with a spatula as they soften while cooking to ensure an even size of chunks. Add a pinch of salt while frying the potatoes.
Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl, season with a pinch of salt, then whisk together with a fork.
Peel and finely slice the onion
Add the onion to the pan and fry it together with the potatoes, adding oil if necessary.
When the onions and potatoes are cooked, carefully pour the eggs on top ensuring the eggs cover the potatoes and onions evenly. Cook the eggs with a low heat until there's almost no runny egg on top.
Use a spatula to slightly lift and loosen the sides of the tortilla. Carefully flip the pan over a dinner plate or large lid and tip out the tortilla, then slide it back into the pan and cook for another 5 minutes, or until golden and cooked through.
